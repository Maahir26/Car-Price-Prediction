# Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning Regression Algorithms

Created a regression model with an MSE score of 355 on car price data based on various car features to help buyers and sellers find fair market values.

## Data & Problem
**Problem:** The goal of this project is to predict car prices based on historical data, using machine learning regression algorithms. This tool aims to assist car dealers and individual buyers in determining competitive pricing for used and new cars.

**Data:** The dataset is split into three smaller datasets in CSV format:
- **Training dataset:** Contains car features and corresponding prices.
- **Test dataset:** 20% of the original data, used to evaluate model accuracy.
- **Validation dataset:** Used for real-time predictions to simulate real-world application.

### Success Metric
The success of the model is measured by aiming to lower the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of our predictions below a target threshold (e.g., MSE < 360).

## Code and Resources Used
- **Python Version:** 3.8
- **Environment:** Miniconda, Jupyter Notebook
- **Packages:** Pandas, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## EDA & Feature Engineering
Detailed the steps of data cleaning, analysis, and preparation of features for the modeling process.
